## Pause Transformer (wip)

Yet another random morning idea to be quickly tried and architecture shared if it works; to allow the transformer to pause for any amount of time on any token.

Again, the idea relies on axial attention; one axis attends along the sequence length as in the usual transformer, the other along a `thinking` or `pause` dimension.
